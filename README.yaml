description: |-
  This GitHub repository is managed by Cloud Ops Works LLC and contains a 
  comprehensive collection of GitHub Actions and workflows. The primary goal 
  of this repository is to streamline and automate the deployment of infrastructure 
  and applications. Whether you're deploying cloud resources or applications, these 
  blueprints can help you achieve a higher level of automation and efficiency in 
  your CI/CD pipelines.
  

# Introduction to the project
introduction: |-
  The Cloud Ops Works Blueprints works along with GitHub Secrets and Variables,
  they should be declared preferably at organization level, and then used in the
    workflows. This way, the secrets and variables are not exposed in the workflows
    and can be managed centrally.
